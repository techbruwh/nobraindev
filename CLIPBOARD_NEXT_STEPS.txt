CLIPBOARD MANAGEMENT FEATURE - NEXT STEPS
==========================================

WHAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED:
✅ Frontend clipboard panel component with UI
✅ Clipboard service for local and cloud operations
✅ Menu sidebar integration with clipboard icon
✅ Database schema for clipboard history (SQLite + Supabase)
✅ Tauri backend commands for clipboard operations
✅ Full sync integration with existing sync workflow
✅ Convert-to-snippet functionality
✅ Search and filter capabilities

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
====================

1. BUILD THE TAURI APP
   - Run: cargo tauri build
   - This compiles the Rust backend with new clipboard commands
   - After successful build, test with: cargo tauri dev

2. SET UP SUPABASE TABLE (Optional - only if you want cloud sync)
   - Open your Supabase project dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy the SQL from: docs/CLIPBOARD_SETUP.md
   - Paste and execute in Supabase
   - This creates the clipboard_history table with RLS policies

3. REBUILD PRODUCTION BUILD
   - After successful testing: ./build.sh
   - This creates the production bundle

4. TEST THE FEATURE
   - Click the "Clipboard" menu in the sidebar
   - Copy some text to your system clipboard
   - Click "Record" or similar to save it
   - Test search, delete, and convert functions
   - Test sync with Account panel

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

⚠️ The clipboard monitoring (auto-recording when you copy) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
   - Currently, you need to manually click to record clipboard entries
   - This can be added later using Tauri's clipboard monitoring APIs

⚠️ The Supabase setup is OPTIONAL for local use
   - You can use clipboard locally without cloud sync
   - To enable cloud features, run the SQL from CLIPBOARD_SETUP.md

⚠️ Make sure CSP in tauri.conf.json includes Supabase domains
   - Already updated, but verify:
   - Should have: https://*.supabase.co in connect-src

FILE LOCATIONS:
===============

Frontend:
  - ui/src/components/ui/clipboardpanel.jsx (Main UI)
  - ui/src/lib/clipboard.js (Service layer)
  - ui/src/components/ui/menusidebar.jsx (Menu integration)

Backend:
  - src-tauri/src/database.rs (Clipboard table methods)
  - src-tauri/src/models.rs (ClipboardEntry struct)
  - src-tauri/src/commands.rs (Tauri commands)
  - src-tauri/src/main.rs (Command registration)

Documentation:
  - docs/CLIPBOARD_SETUP.md (Supabase SQL schema)
  - CLIPBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Full implementation details)
  - CLIPBOARD_NEXT_STEPS.txt (This file)

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

□ Build completes without errors
□ Dev server starts: cargo tauri dev
□ Clipboard menu appears in sidebar
□ Can see clipboard panel when menu is clicked
□ Can manually record clipboard entries
□ Can search clipboard history
□ Can delete individual entries
□ Can clear all entries
□ Can convert entry to snippet (if using snippets)
□ Can sync clipboard if Supabase is set up
□ Production build successful: ./build.sh
□ .app bundle works on macOS (or equivalent on Windows/Linux)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If cargo tauri build fails:
  - Check Rust is updated: rustup update
  - Check Cargo.toml has correct dependencies
  - Check for syntax errors in Rust files

If clipboard commands not found:
  - Verify commands are registered in main.rs
  - Check invoke_handler has all 5 new commands
  - Check commands.rs has #[tauri::command] macro

If Supabase sync not working:
  - Run the SQL schema from CLIPBOARD_SETUP.md
  - Verify table_name is 'clipboard_history'
  - Check RLS policies are enabled
  - Verify user email is being passed correctly

If UI doesn't appear:
  - Check ClipboardPanel is imported in App.jsx
  - Check activeMenu === 'clipboard' condition exists
  - Check menu item is added to menuItems array in MenuSidebar

NEXT FEATURES TO ADD (Optional):
================================

1. Auto-recording: Monitor system clipboard for changes
   - Use Tauri clipboard plugin
   - Auto-save every copy action
   - Configuration to enable/disable

2. Clipboard Monitoring Service
   - Background service to watch clipboard
   - Filter sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
   - Smart categorization

3. Scheduled Cleanup
   - Auto-delete entries older than X days
   - Keep only most recent 100 entries
   - Configurable retention policy

4. Keyboard Shortcuts
   - Quick access to clipboard history (Cmd+Shift+V)
   - Quick convert to snippet
   - Quick sync

5. Statistics
   - Most copied text
   - Usage statistics
   - Productivity insights
